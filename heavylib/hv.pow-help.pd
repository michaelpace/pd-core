#X text 22 10 This abstraction presents an alternative implementation
to the pow~ object. Heavy uses the system's powf() function (as does
Pd) \, but some applications may wish to avoid the powf() function
entirely. Both inlets are signal-rate. This abstraction may also make
use of the hv.exp object instead of the exp~ object.;
