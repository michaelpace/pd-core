#X text 96 437 feed the sqrt ramp into a sine waveshaper (which is
a cosine object with offset of -0.5pi on the input (recall that [cos~]
multiplies its input by 2pi)). this will limit it from -1 to 1 instead
of 0 to the scaled-up value. having scaled it up to 20 (by default)
means that we will go around the unit circle 20 times faster than we
would have otherwise. so \, the scaling-up is effectively affecting
frequency \, not amplitude \, since it comes before this [cos~] (which
is behaving like a sine b/c of the offset). if it came after \, it'd
make it 20 times louder. recall that as you trace angles from pointing
right counter-clockwise around a unit circle \, sin reports the y value
(and cos reports the x value).;

#X text 84 192 give it an exponential (or something? logarithmic?)
shape instead of linear. we are still going from 0 to 1 \, just quickly
from 0 to ~0.4 \, and then more slowly from there to 1 this shape means
that we will be oscillating quickly between 1 and -1 in the sine waveshaper
below at first \, and then we'll slow down. basically \, the slope
of this line — steep at first \, and then levelling off — is what
gives the kick the descending pitch envelope.;
#X text 75 328 scale that up. now going from 0 to 20 (by default) instead
of 0 to 1 this means that we'll pump out 20 complete sine wavelengths
\, but with fluctuating rate (due to the [sqrt~] above). if we didn't
have the [sqrt~] \, this would multiplier in conjunction with the duration
ms would determine constant pitch (e.g. \, 20 wavelengths in 200ms
would be 100hz).;
